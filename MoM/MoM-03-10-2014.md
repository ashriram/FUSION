###Proposol for the Paper was discussed.
### Idea :-
In a heterogeneous system which has a number of accelerators(ACC) connected to the CPU. 
Each ACC has a local scracthpad, which is first filled by data, by host intervention and then it does the compute.
In a system which has multiple ACC's, every time a data needs to be copied from one scratchpad of an ACC to the other, it requires host intervention.
An efficient way to solve the problem would be :-
1. To provide an interface like a scracth pad to the ACC's, so that the access latency is not affected.
2. Provide a cache like behaviour for copying data across sratchpads, so that a coherence protocol can be used for copying across scratchpads without host intervention or even copyig back and forth to the LLC.
