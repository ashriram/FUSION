###Proposol for the Paper was discussed.

Conside a heterogeneous system which has a number of accelerators(ACC's) connected to the CPU. 
Each ACC has a local scracthpad, which is first filled by data, with host intervention and then it does the compute.
In a system which has multiple ACC's, every time a data needs to be copied from one scratchpad of an ACC to the other, it requires host intervention.
An efficient way to solve the problem would be :-
1. To provide an access latency like scracth pads.
2. Provide a cache like behaviour across sratchpads, so that a coherence protocol can be used for copying data across scratchpads without host intervention and even  avoiding copying data back and forth to the LLC whenever possible.
