### Notes

Acc :
    IS -> only 1 GETS
    ISS -> more than 1

CPU:
    IS -> more than 1
    ISS -> 1 GETS

ACC side is 4 hop. CPU side is 3 hop

In L2TCache, all events after Replacement_Clean is used to deal with CPU communication.
MI and MI_Ack -- Extra messages to communicate with the CPU.
 
PUTXACC comes over RequestQueue, DATAACC comes over ResponseQueue.

Pending:
1. New Sequencer needs to be hooked into the new protocol.
2. Network addresses need to be mapped correctly. map_L1CacheMachineID... function needs to fixed. New ones needed for mapping.

Scale factor for scaling the ACC L2 and ACC L1 based on the CPU LLC and L1.

Evaluation platforms:
1. Sequential CPU
2. DMA CPU
3. ACC Baseline
4. ACC Forwarding

Comments : The DMAIN1 includes a fixed DMA setup time, and then the loads are issued from the accelerator side (essentially preloading the cache) so that when the actual trace issues the instructions it will hit and simulate a scratchpad. Then the DMAOUT1 will essentially issues stores from the CPU side so that the data gets pulled back out from the ACC L2 to the CPU side.
